Whisper model is used for this task and it worked well on Hindi as well. Although the model may not detect/transcribe every language, it worked well with languages like English, French, Hindi etc. The audio must be clear inorder to get accurate text. This is tried as a part of learning to know about Transcribing, handling audio inputs etc. One can experiement with different models that are openly available.
